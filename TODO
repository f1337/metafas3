* ReactionView needs refactored into an ObjectProxy descendent. Views should not need extend ReactionView. Instead, ReactionView should "wrap" the View class and process events.
* Once ReactionView extends ObjectProxy, it should implement "method_missing" for Helpers: text_input_for => databinds using TextInputHelper, combo_box_for => databinds using ComboBoxHelper, etc.
* App developers should be provided a means to use only the UI elements required. Ex: helper(ComboBoxHelper) as a static declaration in a class?
